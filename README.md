Communication, not misinformation.
# Populo

**Conversation without manipulation.**

Populo is a human-scale social platform built for people—not algorithms, advertisers, or outrage cycles.

We are designing a social system that prioritizes clarity, context, and trust over engagement metrics and growth-at-all-costs incentives.

## Why Populo Exists

Modern social platforms optimize for attention, not understanding.  
Algorithms reward speed, outrage, and distortion, quietly manipulating what people see and how conversations unfold.

Populo rejects that model.

We believe:
- Users should control their feeds
- Moderation should be transparent and explainable
- Context should inform discussion, not silence it
- Growth should never come at the cost of trust

---

## Core Principles

- **Chronological by default** — No engagement-ranked feeds
- **No shadow bans** — Ever
- **Transparency over optimization**
- **Context over virality**
- **Moderation as a first-class system**

If a feature increases growth but undermines trust, it does not ship.

## Moderation Philosophy

Populo moderates behavior, not beliefs.

All moderation decisions are explainable and auditable.

Populo is for developers, designers, moderators, and contributors who want to build a social system they can defend publicly—and feel proud of privately.
